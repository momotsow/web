                                <br><br><p class="work"> We were given a brief of improving the eating culture of an Umuzi recruit. We focussed on the Umuzi recruit who goes out and buy food using Human Centered Design.
                                  We had a few challenges since everyone have different preferences, there is no strict lunch hour and people buy at different places.
                                  <br>We had to do an MVP which is a Minimum Viable Product and our MVP was to organize a food club for people to go buy lunch in groups an
                                  we organized a "menu" like where we have menus of different restaurants and also got discounts for Umuzi people when they buy in groups; Which then
                                  encourages people to buy in groups and they will socialize in the way.
                                  <br><br>I learnt not to assume that everyone likes the same things and also learnt that people do not know 
                                  a lot of information about where they buy their food-they did not know that the places they buy offer delivery.
                                  
                                  <br><br>As I like to say we have made UMUZI better.
